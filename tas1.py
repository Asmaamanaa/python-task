#Create a Boolean variable named x
#x = 5
#if x > 5:
#    print('False')
#else:

#Create an integer variable named y 
#y = 28
#input('enter your age: ')
#print(input('enter your age: '),input('age is 28'))

#Create a string variable names s
#name = ('s')

#Convert the int variable to float
#num1 = float(input('enter num1'))

#Can we convert the str to int ? yes

#Create a list of numbers from 1 to 5
#list[1,2,3,4,5]

#Create a tuple from 10 to 15
#num = (10,11,12,13,14,15)

#Convert the list to tuple
#list : ["omar","nada"]
#tuple : ("omar","nada")

#Create a dict of 3 values
#employee = {

#Can we use semi colon ; with python? yes

#Python is interpreted or compiled ? interpreted

#What is the differences between low level & high level
#High-levellanguages do not depend on machines ,
#low level languages are machine-dependent and thus very difficult to understand by a normal user

#What is the differences between = , ==
#(=) : Ex:
#name = 'omar'
#(==): equal
#Ex : x == 5

#What do we mean by using !=
#not equal

#What is the operator precedence
#From up to down , From left to right (*,/) befor (+,-)

#Create a variable x with value of 10
x = 10
print(x)

#Increase x value by 15 using assignment operators
x = 1
y = 15
print(1+15)

#Divide the x value by 5 using assignment operators
x = 20
print(x/5)

#Multiply the x value by 10 using assignment operator
x = 2
print(x*10)

#Get module of x on 3 using assignment operators
x = 16
print(16%3)

#Using python print the module of 11 to 4
print(11%4)

#Print the exponent of 2,3
print(2**3)

#Divide 11 by 3 using python division
print(11/3)

#Can we divide 11 by 3 and get an integer number ?
#yes , by module

#Check if 10 is bigger than 15 or not
#no

#If 10 is not bigger than15 print x is smaller than 15
if 10 < 15 :
    print('x')

else :
